Data: IMDB Dataset for Movies Reviews
Basic Statistics: 
- four columns: Ratings, Reviews, Movies(movie name), Resenhas(review translation to portuguese)
- number of reviews: 149780
- number of movies: 14205
- review language: english
- rating between 1 o 10

My Goal: Sentiment Analyzer Model to categorize reviews as positive / negative 
-> we will focus in the data features: rating and review


Approach: 
1. Mapping ratings on one to ten binary classes (positive / negative) 
  (so we need to convert this problem into binary class text classification problem)
2. adressing sentiment challenges as sarcasm, multi polarity and negation
3. develope nlp / ml model to categorize (positive / negative) english text reviws 
4. deploy sentiment analyzer model on AWS cloud using rest API


1. Mapping to Data Science Problem
Start: we have 10 attribute values and we want to class onto 2 classes
Binary Classes: 
- 1 to 10 as "Negative"
- 5 to 6 as "Neutral" -> we will remove this data as we want to focus only on positive and negative
- 7 to 10 as "Positive" 
Goal: Sentiment Value (positive / negative) , Movie attribute liked (and disliked) by majority, 

2. Challenges while developing Sentiment Analyzer
Sarcasm: e.g. negative reviews using positive words 
Multi Polarity: e.g. review is both positive and negative
Negation: e.g. words like "not", "never" as in "I don't call this movie a good movie"
